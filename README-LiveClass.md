## Implementation Details

### Component Architecture

| Component | Purpose | Key Functionality |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| `LiveClassContext.jsx` | Session state management | API integration, error handling |
| `EnhancedJitsiMeet.jsx` | Video conferencing | Connection management, fallbacks |
| `LiveClass.jsx` | UI container | User controls, troubleshooting options |
| `TestJitsiConnection.jsx` | Diagnostics | Connection testing, error resolution |

### Session Flow

#### Teacher Workflow:
1. Navigate to session and initiate "Start Live Class"
2. System creates session via backend API with fallback options
3. Teacher receives moderator privileges
4. Session can be ended for all participants

#### Student Workflow:
1. Join active session via "Join Class" button
2. Connect to teacher's video room through backend API
3. Participate with appropriate permissions
4. Leave session individually as needed

### Reliability Features

- Multi-layered fallback mechanisms
- Authentication bypass for connectivity issues
- Emergency room creation capabilities
- Automatic reconnection system
- Comprehensive troubleshooting tools

## Testing Protocol

1. Create teacher session and initiate live class
2. Join with student account
3. Verify video and audio connectivity
4. Test fallback mechanisms by simulating failures
5. Validate troubleshooting tools functionality

This implementation ensures reliable video conferencing capabilities across various network conditions and system states.
